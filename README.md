## Description

This web application provides users from the FairdataiHub organization with the ability to sign in and access analytics for the applications developed by the organization. The application aims to provide valuable insights and data-driven information to help users understand and optimize their applications' performance and usage.

### Prerequisites/Dependencies

Front-end Framework: The front-end of the application is built with TypeScript and Next.js, which provides a fast and efficient way to develop modern web applications.

Styling: The app's UI is styled using Tailwind.css, a highly customizable CSS framework that enables rapid development and consistent design.

Database: MongoDB is used as the database for this project, providing a flexible and scalable solution for data storage.

User Authentication: The app authenticates users using OAuth2 and integrates with the GitHub API. This allows users to securely log in to the application using their GitHub credentials.

### Installing

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:
Clone the repository: git clone [repository URL]

Install the required dependencies:
```bash
yarn install
```
Configure the OAuth2 authentication with the FairdataiHub organization's credentials, and obtain the client ID and client secret.
Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory of the project and add the following environment variables:

```bash
MONGODB_URI
MONGODB_DBNAME
GITHUB_ID
GITHUB_SECRET
GITHUB_ORG
```

Start the application:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Access the application in your browser at http://localhost:3000

**Note**
Signing in to the application requires a GitHub account that is a member of the FairdataiHub organization. To change to a different organization, update the `GITHUB_ORG` environment variable in the `.env.local` file.
